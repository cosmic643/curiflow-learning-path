# Prompting Principles

# Principle 1:
Write clear and specific instructions

## Tactics

### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- Delimiters can be anything like: `'''`, `"""`, `<>`, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`
For example: 
```
text = "Any piece of text"

prompt = """Summarize the text delimited by double quotes into a single sentence.
""{text}"" """
```

### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
- JSON, HTML
For example:
```
prompt = """Generate a list of three made up book titles with their authors and genres. Provide them in JSON format with the following book_id, title, author, genre."""
```


### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied
For example:
```
prompt = """You will be provided with text delimited by double quotes, if it contains a sequence of instructions, re-write those instructions in the following way:
Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - ...
...
Step N - ...
if the text does not contain a sequence of instructions then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

""{text}""

"""
```

### Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting
For example:
```
prompt = """Your task is to answer in a consistent style
<child>: teach me about patience.
<grandparent>: The river that carves the deep valley flows from a modest spring; the grandest symphony originates from a single note; the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
```

# Principle 2:
Give the model time to "think"

## Tactics

### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task or Ask for output in a specified format
```
# example 1
prompt = f"""
Perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
keys: french_summary, num_names.

Separate your answers with line breaks.

Text:
```{text}```
"""
```

### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
```
prompt = f"""
Your task is to determine if the student's solution \
is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution \ 
and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
"""
Question:
I'm building a solar power installation and I need help working out the financials. 
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations as a function of the number of square feet.
 
Student's solution:
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000

Actual solution:
Steps to work out the solution:
1. Land cost is $100 per square foot, so the land cost for x square feet is 100x.
2. The solar panel cost is $250 per square foot, so for x square feet, the cost is 250x.
3. Maintenance has a flat cost of $100,000 plus an additional $10 per square foot, so the maintenance cost for x square feet is 100,000 + 10x.
4. Add all costs together:
   Total cost = 100x (land) + 250x (solar panels) + 100,000 + 10x (maintenance)
   Simplifying: Total cost = 360x + 100,000

Is the student's solution the same as actual solution just calculated:
no

Student grade:
incorrect
